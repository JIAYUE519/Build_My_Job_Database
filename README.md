# Job-Webscraping-and-analysis

Web-scraped job posts using selenium webdriver from Linkedin. Used Python to compile and analyze data scientist job information in San Francisco, Austin, New York and Seattle. Stored the results in MySQL. 

This module requires selenium webdriver and MySQL. 

$ pip install selenium
$ pip install pymysql

(I do not condone scraping LinkedIn data in any way. Please read LinkedIn's statement on their prohibition of scraping software first)
